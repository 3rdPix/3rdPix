I am a software engineering student at [Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile](https://www.uc.cl/en). 🎯 My main goal at the moment is to advance and complete my studies.

Thanks to university, I have worked with a wide range of tools in data science, numerical analysis, software implementation and creation, etc. Specifically I have worked with embedded programming through FPGA boards, visual applications in the QtFramework through its Python release, website deployments and database management using RubyOnRails, among other minor projects.

These are a bunch of things I'm interested in, in no particular order, just to fill my profile with colours:
