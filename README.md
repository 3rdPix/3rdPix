I'm an undergraduate on the road to be a software engineer. Working on many projects while going at high speeds to the limits of knowledge.
* 🔋 Currently my main focus is to finish games that I thought about when younger
* 🌱 I'm learning all the details and extensions of the Qt6 framework, as well as backend development in Node JS. Closed to no form of new ideas or knowledge ╰(*°▽°*)╯ 
* 👯 **Always open** to help, learn, and work on new things. Feel free to invite me!
* 🎯 My dream is to work at [Ankama](https://www.ankama.com/en/about)
