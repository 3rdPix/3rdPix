I am a software engineering student at the [Pontifical Catholic University of Chile](https://www.uc.cl/en). 🎯 My main goal at the moment is to progress and complete my studies📚, however, I am always willing to participate in projects and learn new work and development environments👨🏻‍💻.

I enjoy software and video game development; when I was young, I dreamed of developing my own operating system, which drove me from an early age to approach the world of technology with languages like Visual Basic or C++. Thanks to university, I have worked with a wide range of tools in data science, numerical analysis, software implementation, and creation, etc. I also have an affinity for mathematics and have published small analyses on [Wolfram Community](https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2569841).

I have experience related to data analysis with libraries such as [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html), [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and the development of computational tools mainly in the [PyQt](https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python) framework for user interfaces.
